**Short Description:**

India faces immense challenges with cyclones every year. This project develops a predictive and analytical AI model to forecast cyclones and their impact, enabling timely evacuations and minimizing life and economic losses.

**Key Features:**

* **Early Warning System:** Predicts cyclone tracks and intensity beforehand, providing crucial time for preparation and response.
* **Data-Driven Insights:** Analyzes diverse data sources like satellite imagery, meteorological observations, and historical records for accurate predictions.
* **Actionable Outputs:** Generates clear and actionable outputs for meteorological departments, government agencies, and communities.
* **Potential Benefits:** Saves lives, minimizes economic losses, and assists in resource allocation for effective disaster management.

**Technologies Used:**
* **Data science:** NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
* **Machine learning and deep learning:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Pillow.
* **Desktop applications:** PyQt, Tkinter, Kivy.
